The Bulk Edit app allows a user to apply changes to multiple FOLIO records simultaneously. 

Bulk edit can apply changes to these **record types**:

- [**Inventory - holdings**](#inventory---holdings)
- [**Inventory - instances**](#inventory---instances)
- [**Inventory - items**](#inventory---items)
- [**Users**](#users)

For more information about record types in the Inventory app, see [Metadata \> Inventory](../metadata/inventory/_index.md).

For more information about User records, see [Users \> View a user record](../users/_index.md#view-a-user-record).

## Permissions

The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the Bulk Edit app and determine what you can or cannot do within the app. Bulk edit permissions, combined with other functional app permissions, allow a user to access specific areas of the Bulk Edit app.  

Permissions are assigned to users in the Users app. If none of the Bulk edit permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the Bulk Edit app or any related information. 
See [Users \> Assign or unassign permissions](../users/#assign-or-unassign-permissions) for more information. 

The following are the permissions for the Bulk edit app:

- **Bulk edit: Can build query**: This permission allows the user to build and test a query, and preview matched records in the Bulk edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: Can view logs** This permission allows the user to download and view logs in the Bulk Edit app.
- **Bulk edit: In app - Edit inventory records** This permission allows the user to edit a field in multiple inventory records in the Bulk Edit app.

- **Bulk edit: Local - View user records** This permission allows the user to view a list of identified user records in Bulk Edit by uploading a .csv file.


## Identify records for bulk edit

The Bulk edit app provides two methods for identifying records: **Identifier** and **Query**. 

### Identifier

The **Identifier** approach allows the user to set criteria for the bulk edit by uploading a list of record identifiers from a .csv file. Only .csv files containing one column of record identifiers are accepted for upload in the Bulk edit app. If the .csv file contains more than one column, the upload will not be successful and an error message, "_filename_ is formatted incorrectly. Please correct the formatting and upload the file again" displays.

To set criteria for bulk edit using **Identifier**, follow these steps: 

1. In the **Set Criteria** pane, select the **Identifier** button.
2. Select the **Record type**.
3. Select the **Record identifier** from the **Select record identifier** drop-down menu. Record identifiers available for selection are based on the Record type.
4. **Drag and drop** your .csv file into the **Select a file with record identifiers** box, or click **or choose file** to upload the .csv file from your computer.

### Query

The **Query** function in the Bulk Edit app allows the user to build a query to identify records for bulk edit. 

To set criteria for bulk edit using **Query**, follow these steps: 

1. In the **Set Criteria** pane, click on the **Query** tab.
2. Select the **Record type**.
3. Click the **Build query** button to open the **Build query** modal.
4. Select a **Field** from the *Select field* drop-down menu or filter the selection by typing the field in the *Filter options list* text box.
5. Select an **Operator** from the *Select operator* drop-down list. The operators available for selection are based on the **Field**. 

   - ==: Field equals selected or input Value.
   - !=:  Field does not equal selected or input Value.
   - Contains: Field appears in selected or input Value.
   - Starts: Field starts with selected or input Value.
   - \>: Field is greater than the selected or input Value.
   - <: Field is less than the selected or input Value.
   - \>=: Field is greater than or equal to the selected or input Value.
   - <=: Field is less than or equal to the selected or input Value.
   - Is null/empty: Field is blank; it contains no data.

6. Select a **Value** from the *Select value* drop-down list or type the value in the text box.  The values available for selection are based on the **Field** and **Operator**.
7. Click on the **+ icon** to add additional lines to the query or click on the **trash can icon** to delete a line from the query.
8. Once a query is built, it must be tested before the query can be run and saved. Click the **Test query** button to run the query and display a preview of matched records. The query string can be edited in the **Query string** field. If edited, another Test query must be done.
9. If the Test query is successful, click the **Run query** button to run the query and preview the matched records in the **Bulk edit query** modal.

## Preview matched records

If the **Identifier** method is used to identify records for bulk edit, the number of records matched and the filename display at the top of the **Bulk edit** modal. 

If the **Query** method is used to identify records for bulk edit, a **Test query** displays the query string and number of matched records at the top of the **Build query** modal. 

If the query is run, the **Query** and a preview of matched records display in the **Bulk edit query** modal. 

To add or remove record identifier columns in the preview pane, click the **Actions** button. 

   - In the **Show columns** section of the Actions menu, check the box next to the name of the record identifier to include as a column in the preview.
   - Uncheck the box next to the name of the record identifier to remove the column from the preview.

## Download matched records

If desired, download the matched records as a .csv file:
   
   - In the **Preview** pane, click **Actions** and select **Download matched records (CSV)**.
   - Depending on the web browser settings, the .csv file may be opened and/or saved. 

## Download errors

If there are errors in the matched records, a message indicating the filename, number of entries, number of records matched, and number of errors displays in a two-column table in the **Errors** section. 

- **Record identifier.** The record identifier for the records that produced the error.
- **Reason for error.** The reason why the error was produced.

To download the list of errors as a .csv file, follow these steps:

1. In the **Preview** pane, select **Actions > Download errors (CSV)**.

## Start bulk edit

The **Start bulk edit** approach allows bulk edit to change the **Email**, **Expiration Date**, and/or **Patron Group** fields in matching user records. Bulk edit may be performed on each of these fields individually or simultaneously. 

To perform bulk edit on matched **User records** using the **Start bulk edit** method, follow these steps:

1. In the **Preview** pane, click **Actions > Start bulk edit**. The number of matched user records and the filename of the .csv file display at the top of the **Bulk edit** window.
2. In the **Bulk edits** section, select the option from the **Select options** drop-down menu. To bulk edit all three fields simultaneously, click the **+ icon** at the end of the row to add another bulk edit option. 

   - **Email**: Bulk edit performs a find and replace in the email address field of the matched user records. Thus, the **Actions** available are **Find (full field search)** and **Replace with**. Type the current data (text) in the **Find (full field search)** box. Type the new data (text) in the **Replace with** box. 
   - **Expiration date**: Bulk edit replaces the data in the Expiration date of the matched user records. Thus, the **Actions** available are limited to **Replace with**.  Type the new expiration date in MM/DD/YYYY format in the **Data** box or use the **calendar icon** to select a date.
   - **Patron group**: Bulk edit replaces the Patron group data in the matched user records. Thus, the **Actions** available are limited to **Replace with**. Select the new Patron group from the **Data** drop-down menu. 

3. Click the **Confirm changes** button. The message *(Number of) records will be changed if the Commit changes button is clicked* displays in the **Are you sure?** modal.
   
   - Click **Keep editing** to return to the Bulk edit window.
   - Click **Download preview** to review all changes prior to saving.* A **Preview of records to be changed** is also displayed.
   - Click **Commit changes** to run bulk edit and save the changes to the matched user records.

4. When the bulk edit is complete, a confirmation message, *(Number of) records have been successfully changed*, appears in the **Bulk edit** window.
5. To change the column headings in the **Preview of record changed** table, click **Actions** and select or deselect the fields in the **Show columns** list as appropriate.
6. To download a .csv file of changed records, click **Actions > Download changed records (CSV)**. 


### Start bulk edit (Local)

The **Start bulk edit (Local)** function allows the user to perform a bulk edit on user records edited locally (external to FOLIO) by uploading a .csv file of the changed, or edited, user records. 

Any field in user records can be changed using the **Bulk edit (Local)** approach.

To perform bulk edit on user records using the **Start bulk edit (Local)** approach, follow these steps: 

1. In the **Set criteria** pane, select **Users** as the **Record type** and select the appropriate **Record identifier**: **User UUIDs**, **User barcodes**, **External IDs**, or **Usernames**.
2. Upload a .csv file with the selected Record identifier by either using the **Drag and drop** option or clicking the **Choose file** button.
3. Select **Actions \> Download matched records (CSV)** to download a .csv file of matched user records; or select **Actions \> Download errors (CSV)** to download a .csv file of records that did not match your selected record identifier.
4. Edit the downloaded .csv file and make changes to the user records in the file itself. Save the edited .csv file to your computer.
5. Select **Actions \> Start bulk edit (Local)**.
6. In the **Bulk edit** window, **Drag and drop** the .csv file into the **Upload CSV file with edited records** box, or click **or choose file** to upload the .csv file from your computer. If the .csv file is uploaded successfully, the confirmation message, *(Name of File).csv successfully uploaded*, displays in a new window.
7. Click **Next**. The warning message, *(Number of) records will be updated if the **Commit changes** button is clicked.* appears in a new window.
Click **Commit changes**. Bulk edit will apply and save the local changes to the matched user records in FOLIO.
